<!-- Briefly describe your app , It's main features and how to use it. -->

App Description: *The data source for this application is the Australian Wine Sales dataset provided in the course module as a CSV file. Although the fpp3 ecosystem includes a similar dataset, this project was developed using the provided CSV file. The assignment requirements guided the modeling choices, which specified the use of TSLM, ETS, and ARIMA models. Each wine variety behaves differently depending on the underlying patterns and trends in the data. Forecasts were generated over a 24-month horizon to provide a sufficient evaluation period to compare each model. To reproduce the figures and results, refer to the full R code provided in StorytellingWithShiny.qmd. The code includes all necessary steps from data loading and wrangling to model fitting, forecasting, evaluation, and visualization.*

App Features:

-   *Interactive UI for model selection and parameter tuning*
-   *Dynamic visualizations of forecasts and model performance metrics*
-   ...

## Part II — Data Story (≤ 2 pages total)

### Insight: 

Comparing the wine varietals shows that each requires a different forecasting model, as evidenced by MAPE, a scale-adjusted error metric. RMSE is scale-dependent; however, it can be misleading, since varietals with low sales volumes naturally produce lower RMSE values even when the model fit is not superior. MAPE reveals the actual differences in forecasting performance. For example, red wine is best modeled with ARIMA (MAPE 8.63%), outperforming ETS (10.43%) and TSLM (11.79%). In contrast, fortified wine forecasts best with ETS (MAPE 10.24%), compared to higher errors from ARIMA (11.65%) and TSLM (16.25%). This pattern of different varietals favoring different models highlights that each wine type has its own time-series structure, and the best forecasting approach must be tailored to the specific varietal rather than relying on a single global model.
